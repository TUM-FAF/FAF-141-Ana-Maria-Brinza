# Laboratory work 2

##Objectives:

- Make a simple GUI Calculator
- Default operations are: +,-,*,/,power,sqrt,SignInversion(+/-),operation with decimal floating point.
- Divide your program in two modules - the GUI module and Core Module.
- Plot a graph when user input contains a function

##Accomplished tasks:

- I made a simple GUI calculator with basic functions such as +, -, /, *, power, sqrt and SignInversion(+/-), operation with decimal floating point.
- I've made two files: a .ui file, that defines the UI and the .py file where I defined the logic module
- I've added a song using PyQt's Phonon (just run my application and you will feel the magic)

##Working process

In order to develop my application I used PyQt4 which  is one of the two most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework. 
I used Qt Designer for creating the interface of my calculator and then all the logic part was build in PyQt - a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt. It is one of Python's options for GUI programming. As well I used PyQt Phonon in order to add a song to my application. 
So, finally what I obtained is a *fluffy* pink calculator that works perfectly and can perform 6 diffrent operations:
* 1.Addition
* 2.Substraction
* 3.Multiplication
* 4.Division
* 5.Power
* 6.Sqrt
And even more you can easily use Sign Invertion(+/-) and operation with decimal point.

I, personally see a big usage for that application. In my opinion the perfect use for it is for pupils and children  in the kindergarden. Why? 
* It is colourful 
* It is simple to use
* It has the basic operations
* It has a pleasant song that motivates you do your calculations and not quit the application
* It is original
* It is pink
* 
#Conclusion

To build a calculator was a challange for me and a lot of fun! In the beggining I thought it is almost impposible.
