# Laboratory work 2

##Objectives:

- Make a simple GUI Calculator
- Default operations are: +,-,*,/,power,sqrt,SignInversion(+/-),operation with decimal floating point.
- Divide your program in two modules - the GUI module and Core Module.
- Plot a graph when user input contains a function

##Accomplished tasks:

- I made a simple GUI calculator with basic functions such as +, -, /, *, power, sqrt and SignInversion(+/-), operation with decimal floating point.
- I've made two files: a .ui file, that defines the UI and the .py file where I defined the logic module
- I've added a song using PyQt's Phonon (just run my application and you will feel the magic)

##Working process

In order to develop my application I used PyQt4 which  is one of the two most popular Python bindings for the Qt cross-platform GUI/XML/SQL C++ framework. 
I used Qt Designer for creating the interface of my calculator and then all the logic part was build in PyQt - a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt. It is one of Python's options for GUI programming. As well I used PyQt Phonon in order to add a song to my application. 
So, finally what I obtained is a *fluffy* pink calculator that works perfectly and can perform 6 diffrent operations:
* 1.Addition
* 2.Substraction
* 3.Multiplication
* 4.Division
* 5.Power
* 6.Sqrt
And even more you can easily use Sign Invertion(+/-) and operation with decimal point.

I, personally see a big usage for that application. In my opinion the perfect use for it is for pupils and children  in the kindergarden. Why? 
* It is colourful 
* It is simple to use
* It has the basic operations
* It has a pleasant song that motivates you do your calculations and not quit the application
* It is original
* It is pink


Are you curious how the *fluffy* pink Calculator looks like?
Here it is an image of it:

# Conclusion

To build a calculator was a challange for me and a lot of fun! In the beggining I thought it is almost impposible and it was quite difficult to choose the IDE and the programming languages. It took one week to decide what shall I use: C++, Python, or maybe something new, like: JS, HTML and CSS. I made some researches, for two days I learned some basic of CSS, and to be honest it seems to be easy and comfortable to use but finally I returned to what I already knew: Python! 
It was interesting to build the application, I learned a lot of new stuff, I learned new technologies and Frameworks(PyQt, Phonon in Python) and I tried to devide my program in two modules: the GUI module(which is my interface.ui file) and the Core module (my calc.py file). 

As well, to make things more interesting I have done something new for myself (never tried before) I just wanted a song to play when you open and work with the calculated, and after a few hours of work  ”Here it is!” we have an calculator that wil entertain you!
