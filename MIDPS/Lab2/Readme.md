# Laboratory work 2

##Objectives:

- Make a simple GUI Calculator
- Default operations are: +,-,*,/,power,sqrt,SignInversion(+/-),operation with decimal floating point.
- Divide your program in two modules - the GUI module and Core Module.
- Plot a graph when user input contains a function

##Accomplished tasks:

- I made a simple GUI calculator with basic functions such as +, -, /, *, power, sqrt and SignInversion(+/-), operation with decimal floating point.
- I've made two files: a .ui file, that defines the UI and the .py file where I defined the logic module
- I've added a song using PyQt's Phonon (just run my application and you will feel the magic)
