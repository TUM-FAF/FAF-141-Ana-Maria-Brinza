# Windows Programming Laboratory Work #4

## Title
Windows Timer. Animation.

## Contents
* Windows timer

### Laboratory work Requirements:
  - for _Basic Level_ (grade 5 || 6) you should be able to:
    * Create an animation based on Windows timer which involves at least 5 different drawn objects
  - for _Normal Level_ (grade 7 || 8) you should be able to:
    * Realize the tasks from _Basic Level_.
    * Increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from keebord 
    * Solve flicking problem _describe in your readme/report the way you had implemented this_
  - for _Advanced Level_ (grade 9 || 10) you should be able to:
    * Realize the tasks from _Norma Level_ without _Basic Level_
    * Add 2 animated objects which will interact with each other. Balls that have different velocity and moving angles. They should behave based on following rules:
        * At the begining you should have 3 bals of different colours of the same size
        * On interaction with each other, if they are of the same class (circle, square), they shuld change their color and be multiplied.
        * On interaction with the right and left wall (the margins of the window), they should be transformed into squares.
        * On interaction with the top and bottom of the window - the figures should increase their velocity.
        * Please, take into consideration that the user can increase and decrease animation speed using mouse wheel/from keebord 
    
  - for _Bonus Point Tasks_ :
    * For the task above, add balls with mouse.
